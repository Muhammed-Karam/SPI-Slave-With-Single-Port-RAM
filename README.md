# 🔌 SPI Slave with Single Port RAM

A Verilog implementation of an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) slave module interfaced with a single-port synchronous RAM, designed for FPGA deployment with comprehensive verification and timing optimization.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a complete SPI slave communication system that interfaces with a single-port RAM module. The design allows external masters to read from and write to memory through the standardized SPI protocol, making it suitable for embedded systems and FPGA-based applications.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 🧩 System Components

1. **SPI Slave Interface**
   - 4-wire SPI communication (MOSI, MISO, SCK, SS_n)
   - FSM-based implementation with multiple encoding options
   - Serial-to-parallel and parallel-to-serial data conversion

2. **Single Port RAM**
   - Parameterizable memory depth (default: 256 words)
   - 8-bit data width with 10-bit command interface
   - Synchronous operation with active-low reset
   - Separate read/write address handling

### 📡 SPI Interface Signals

| Signal | Direction | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| MOSI   | Input     | Master Out, Slave In - Data from master |
| MISO   | Output    | Master In, Slave Out - Data to master |
| SCK    | Input     | Serial Clock from master |
| SS_n   | Input     | Slave Select (active low) |
| clk    | Input     | System clock |
| rst_n  | Input     | Active low synchronous reset |

### 💾 RAM Interface Signals

| Signal | Direction | Width | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| din    | Input     | 10    | Data input with command bits |
| rx_valid | Input   | 1     | Data valid signal |
| dout   | Output    | 8     | Data output |
| tx_valid | Output  | 1     | Output data valid |

## 📟 Command Protocol

The system uses a 10-bit command structure where `din[9:8]` determines the operation:

| din[9:8] | Command | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| 00       | Write Address | Store din[7:0] as write address |
| 01       | Write Data | Write din[7:0] to previously stored write address |
| 10       | Read Address | Store din[7:0] as read address |
| 11       | Read Data | Read from previously stored read address, output on dout |

## 🤖 State Machine

The SPI slave operates using a finite state machine with the following states:

- **IDLE**: Default state, waiting for SS_n assertion
- **CHK_CMD**: Command detection based on first received bit
- **WRITE**: Handle write operations (address/data)
- **READ_ADD**: Handle read address setup
- **READ_DATA**: Handle read data transmission

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple FSM Encodings**: Gray, One-hot, and Sequential encoding options
- **Timing Optimization**: Encoding selection based on timing analysis
- **FPGA Ready**: Complete constraint files and bitstream generation
- **Debug Support**: Integrated debug cores for signal analysis
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full testbench with state transition verification

## 🚀 Usage

### 🔬 Simulation

# In QuestaSim:
```bash
vsim -do run.do
```

### 🛠️ FPGA Implementation

1. **Synthesis**: The design supports multiple FSM encodings
2. **Implementation**: Choose encoding based on timing reports
3. **Constraints**: Map signals to FPGA pins using provided constraints
4. **Bitstream**: Generate and deploy to target FPGA

### 📍 Pin Mapping

- `rst_n`: Connected to switch
- `SS_n`: Connected to switch  
- `MOSI`: Connected to switch
- `MISO`: Connected to LED

## 💡 Operation Examples

### ✍️ Write Operation
1. Send write address (din[9:8] = 00, din[7:0] = address)
2. Send write data (din[9:8] = 01, din[7:0] = data)
3. Data is stored at specified address

### 📖 Read Operation
1. Send read address (din[9:8] = 10, din[7:0] = address)
2. Send read command (din[9:8] = 11)
3. Data appears on MISO during read command when tx_valid is high
