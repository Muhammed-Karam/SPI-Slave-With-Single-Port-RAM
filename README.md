# SPI-Slave-With-Single-Port-RAM
A Verilog-based SPI Slave interface connected to a parameterized single-port RAM. It features serial-to-parallel conversion, command decoding, and FSM-based control for executing memory read/write operations via a 10-bit SPI protocol. A directed testbench acts as the SPI Master, providing simulation support for full functional verification.
